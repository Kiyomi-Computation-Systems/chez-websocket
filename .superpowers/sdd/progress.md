# chez-websocket — subagent-driven development ledger

`progress.md` is the spine; `global-constraints.md` binds every task brief. Read both before starting slice work. Close-outs are recorded here.

M-1 — PLANNING. Branch `docs/planning-record`. 2026-10-04.

**Where it began.** In chez-http-server, on the owner's "Let's begin the websocket path", four forms decided the library (that repository's decision 0022): a sibling library, this one; code that reads with a call that waits; RFC 6455 alone; Autobahn in Linux CI. On "Create it now" the repository was made, private, its first commit the siblings' BSD 3-Clause license (27ad906). The server then gained the door change this library needs, decision 0023 (a take-over may answer `(awaiting thunk)`), and released it as v0.3.0, tagged on 5528fa4 on 2026-10-04.

**Delivered:**
- **The brief** (`.plans/2026-10-04-chez-websocket-project-brief.md`): the goal, what is settled and where, where the library stops, the pure core and the binding, the facts it starts from, the milestones in outline, the standing risks.
- **This ledger and `global-constraints.md`**, the server's house rules in this project's spellings.
- **`AGENTS.md`**, the server's, with this project's dependency (chez-http-server at a release tag, carrying chez-libuv, chez-httparse and uriparse).
- **`README.org`** says the project is in planning, and **`CHANGELOG.md`** holds an empty Unreleased.

**Measured environment, 2026-10-04:** Darwin 25.6.0 arm64 (Apple M1, 8 cores). Chez Scheme 10.4.1 `tarm64osx`, threaded; libuv 1.52.1 (Homebrew pkg-config); CMake 4.3.3; Docker 29.2.1.

**Not done here:** no code, no Makefile and no CI. They are M0's, stacked on this.

NEXT: M0, the skeleton, stacked on this branch. Then the design and the milestone plan, with their decisions by form.
